#Full-Stack Document App
This project is a full-stack document application, similar to Google Docs, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

#Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration system using JWT tokens.
Document Storage: Save, update, and retrieve documents using MongoDB.

Rich Text Editing: Integrated rich text editor for a better document creation experience.
Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
